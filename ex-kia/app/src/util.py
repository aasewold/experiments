    """Calculate the distance between a point and a line segment.

    To calculate the closest distance to a line segment, we first need to check
    if the point projects onto the line segment.  If it does, then we calculate
    the orthogonal distance from the point to the line.
    If the point does not project to the line segment, we calculate the 
    distance to both endpoints and take the shortest distance.

    :param point: Numpy array of form [x,y], describing the point.
    :type point: numpy.core.multiarray.ndarray
    :param line: list of endpoint arrays of form [P1, P2]
    :type line: list of numpy.core.multiarray.ndarray
    :return: The minimum distance to a point.
